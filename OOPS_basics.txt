
- OOPS comes wth concept of class and object.
- Its a paradigm for modelling real world function of entities to program, here any template is already defined but just we create instance of pre
  defined templates
  OOPS.class()
  {
       Definition :
                           class is user defined data type.
                           its pre existing template.
       Reason :
                       Real world system and entities functions like class, so used to map real world entities

       Memory()
       {
                       Class never occupies the memory of system
                       class.RAM.system() == 0;

       }

       class.object() {

                  Properties:
                                     properties.DataMembers( variables );
                                     properties.MemberFunctions( functions )

                  Definition:
                                     object is instance of class
                                     occupies physical memory on basis of defined properties() of class
                                     If ( class.properties == 0 ) {
                                          object.Memory() == 1 B ;   // to track the object in system's memory
                                     }

       }
  }
